This post will detail how to use a windows command prompts and Python to scrape Twitter data for a single user account and then explain how to organize and visualize retweet and favorite data for three different types of Dallas Police Department tweets. The following steps explain how to download tweets from the Dallas Police Department Twitter account.

First, make sure to have at least Python 3 on your computer. Next, you will need to have pip installed on your pc. Once those are both completed, go to [Nickersen Weng's github](https://github.com/NicksonWeng/Get-Old-Tweet-Modified) and download the files from the repository to a folder of your choice. Just remember where you save and extract them because you will need to set the path directory to the same folder as those files later on.

Using the Windows command prompt (just type cmd in the search bar on the bottom left), enter the following commands in sequence.

#Any line with # is comment, rest is entered at end of directory and after the >
#first, make sure pip has been installed on your device

#check to make sure you have python
python

#exit python environment
exit()

#set working directory to the Twitterdata folder that you have the unzipped files in
cd Dropbox\Twitterdata

#install GetOldTweets3
python -m pip install GetOldTweets3

#execute Twitter search and download - multiple options
#keyword search example: python Exporter.py --querysearch "Keyword Here" --since YEAR-MM-DD --until YEAR-MM-DD --maxtweets XXX --output filename.csv
#notes: keyword may be case sensitive; since = start date; until = end date
#username search: python Exporter.py --username "username" --since YEAR-MM-DD --until YEAR-MM-DD --maxtweets XXX --output filename.csv
#notes: username may be case sensitive and should include all characters after the @; since = start date; until = end date

#I used the following command to download all tweets from the Dallas Police Department's Twitter account. Note: if you do not want all tweets, restrict the date or set a maxtweet limit.
python Exporter.py --username "DallasPD" --since 2009-04-01 --until 2020-06-06 --output dpd_tweets.csv

#What happened to me during this process is that it stopped at 2014-10-31, so I had one .csv file with all DPD tweets from 10/31/2014 - 6/5/2020, so I had to run the following command in the Windows command prompt
python Exporter.py --username "DallasPD" --since 2009-04-01 --until 2014-10-31 --output dpd_tweets1.csv

After that is done, you can exit the Windows command prompt. You will no longer need it. Next, open up R or RStudio to
