This post will detail how to use Windows command prompts and Python to scrape Twitter data for a single user account (Dallas Police Department in this case) and then explain how to organize and visualize retweet and favorite data for three different types of Dallas Police Department tweets. The goal is to compare the retweet and like distribution for three different types of tweets (homicide, missing persons, and protests) to try and understand how the public receives them.

The following steps explain how to download tweets from the Dallas Police Department Twitter account.

First, make sure to have at least Python 3 on your computer. Next, you will need to have pip installed on your pc. Once those are both completed, go to [Nickersen Weng's github](https://github.com/NicksonWeng/Get-Old-Tweet-Modified) and download the files from the repository to a folder of your choice. Just remember where you save and extract them because you will need to set the path directory to the same folder as those files later on.

Using the Windows command prompt (just type cmd in the search bar on the bottom left), enter the following commands in sequence.

Any line with # at the beginning is a comment and does not need to be entered into the Windows command prompt. The other lines should be entered at end of directory and after the >. First, make sure pip has been installed on your device, then enter the following in your command prompt. 

```
#check to make sure you have python
python

#exit python environment
exit()

#set working directory to the Twitterdata folder that you have the unzipped files in
cd Dropbox\Twitterdata

#install GetOldTweets3
python -m pip install GetOldTweets3

#execute Twitter search and download - multiple options
#keyword search example: python Exporter.py --querysearch "Keyword Here" --since YEAR-MM-DD --until YEAR-MM-DD --maxtweets XXX --output filename.csv
#notes: keyword may be case sensitive; since = start date; until = end date
#username search: python Exporter.py --username "username" --since YEAR-MM-DD --until YEAR-MM-DD --maxtweets XXX --output filename.csv
#notes: username may be case sensitive and should include all characters after the @; since = start date; until = end date

#I used the following command to download all tweets from the Dallas Police Department's Twitter account. Note: if you do not want all tweets, restrict the date or set a maxtweet limit.
python Exporter.py --username "DallasPD" --since 2009-04-01 --until 2020-06-06 --output dpd_tweets.csv

#What happened to me during this process is that it stopped at 2014-10-31, so I had one .csv file with all DPD tweets from 10/31/2014 - 6/5/2020, so I had to run the following command in the Windows command prompt
python Exporter.py --username "DallasPD" --since 2009-04-01 --until 2014-10-31 --output dpd_tweets1.csv
```

After that is done, you can exit the Windows command prompt. Next, open up R or RStudio to 1) manage the data and 2) visualize retweet and favorite densities for DPD tweets about missing persons, homicides, and protests. The next few blocks of R code should help you recreate the images you see in this post.

```
rm(list=ls())
setwd("C:/Users/jorda/Dropbox/PHDWork/Summer2020/EPPS7v81_DataScience/Exercise1")

#load packages
library(data.table)

#load downloaded .csv files and append them to one another
file1 <- read.csv(file="dpdtweets.csv", header=T, sep=";")
file2 <- read.csv(file="dpdtweets1.csv", header=T, sep=";")
dpdtweets <- rbind(file1,file2)
```

Now, here is where I'm open to suggestions on different keywords that could indicate a tweet about a missing person, homicide, or protest. To try and identify missing persons tweets, I went with missing, missing person, and missing persons. For tweets about homicide, I used the words homicide, homicides, murder, murders,  killing, and killings, and for tweets about protests, the words protest, protester, protestor, protesters, protestors, and protesting. If there are other words or phrases you think would be helpful to identify tweets about missing persons, homicide, or protests, just let me know. In the actual search execution, the ignore.case = TRUE option does not require an exact match of lower to lower case text, so we don't have to worry about capitalizing certain letters (or if the tweet was posted with irregular capitalization ex: PRotestor).

```
#create indicators for when they tweet about someone that is missing, a homicide, or a protest
#missing - "missing" "missing person" 
missingmatch <- c("missing", "missing person", "missing persons")

#homicide - "homicide" "murder" 
homicidematch <- c("homicide", "homicides", "murder", "murders", "killing", "killings")

#protest - "protest" "protesters" 
protestmatch <- c("protest", "protester", "protestor", "protesters", "protestors", "protesting")

#search for keywords in the text column and create an true/false indicator for the tweets they show up in
dpdtweets$missingperson <- grepl(paste(missingmatch,collapse="|"), dpdtweets$text, ignore.case = TRUE)
dpdtweets$homicide <- grepl(paste(homicidematch,collapse="|"), dpdtweets$text, ignore.case = TRUE)
dpdtweets$protest <- grepl(paste(protestmatch,collapse="|"), dpdtweets$text, ignore.case = TRUE)

#apply numeric indicators to T/F logic indicators - does so for every boolean column in the data.frame
Cols <-  which(sapply(dpdtweets, is.logical))
setDT(dpdtweets)
for(j in Cols){
  set(dpdtweets, i=NULL, j=j, value= as.numeric(dpdtweets[[j]]))
}

#see how many of each kind of tweet there are
table(dpdtweets$missingperson)
table(dpdtweets$homicide)
table(dpdtweets$protest)

#convert retweet and favorite data from character to numeric
dpdtweets$retweets <- as.numeric(dpdtweets$retweets)
dpdtweets$favorites <- as.numeric(dpdtweets$favorites)

#subset data by removing the select few observations that are clearly messed up (way too high retweet/favorite count - DPD isn't that popular)
dpdtweet <- subset(dpdtweets, dpdtweets$retweets < 100000 | dpdtweets$favorites <100000)

#create objects with subsets of data for each type of tweet; recall 1=presence of keywords & 0=absence
missing <- subset(dpdtweet, dpdtweet$missingperson > 0)
homicide <- subset(dpdtweet, dpdtweet$homicide > 0)
protest <- subset(dpdtweet, dpdtweet$protest > 0)

#check to see new summary statistics
summary(dpdtweet$retweets)
summary(dpdtweet$favorites)

summary(missing$retweets)
summary(missing$favorites)

summary(homicide$retweets)
summary(homicide$favorites)

summary(protest$retweets)
summary(protest$favorites)
```

We can take a quick look at the favorites by retweet plots for our three types of tweets. This gives a sense of how the information is received. Are people retweeting the content and sharing it with other users? Or simply liking/favoriting it - which sometimes shows up in other people's Twitter feeds but depends on people's settings. 

```
#plot likes vs retweet for the missing, homicides, protests;
png(file="missing.png", width=12, height=8, units="in", res=300)
plot(missing$retweets, missing$favorites, main="Favorites by Retweets; DPD Missing Persons Tweets", xlab="Retweets", ylab="Favorites", cex.main=2, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)
dev.off()
```

For missing persons tweets, it looks like these are mainly retweeted to spread the information about. It is possible that there are two types of tweets, and my hypothesis would be tweets about missing people that have been found are liked or favorited more and tweets about people being missing or DPD searching for them are retweeted rather than favorited. 
```
png(file="homicide.png", width=12, height=8, units="in", res=300)
plot(homicide$retweets, homicide$favorites, main="Favorites by Retweets; DPD Homicide Tweets", xlab="Retweets", ylab="Favorites", cex.main=2, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)
dev.off()
```

The presence of two well performing tweets makes it hard to really see how the rest of DPD's homicide related tweets are received. Removing those and then recreating the plot makes it a little easier to see that most homicide related tweets do not get very much play in the Twitterverse. Note: the two well performing tweets about homicide were related to 1) a person of interest in the attempted murder of two police officers and 2) the identification of suspects in the killing of Joshua Brown, a witness who testified against Amber Guyger and was killed shortly after her conviction.

```
homicide.df <- data.frame(homicide)
hom_sub <- subset(homicide.df, homicide.df$retweets <300 | homicide.df$favorites <400)

png(file="hom_sub.png", width=12, height=8, units="in", res=300)
plot(hom_sub$retweets, hom_sub$favorites, main="Favorites by Retweets; DPD Homicide Tweets", xlab="Retweets", ylab="Favorites", cex.main=2, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)

dev.off
```

Tweets about protests get far more likes and favorites than tweets about homicide or missing persons. Kind of makes sense, because people might feel weird "liking" a tweet about someone going missing or someone being killed.
```
#you can also look at the plots by scaling retweets and favorites per tweet
# plot(missing$retweets/length(missing$retweets), missing$favorites/length(missing$favorites), main="Favorites by Retweets; DPD Missing Persons Tweets", xlab="Retweets", ylab="Favorites")
# plot(homicide$retweets/length(homicide$retweets), homicide$favorites/length(homicide$favorites), main="Favorites by Retweets; DPD Homicide Tweets", xlab="Retweets", ylab="Favorites")
# plot(protest$retweets/length(protest$retweets), protest$favorites/length(protest$favorites), main="Favorites by Retweets; DPD Protest Tweets", xlab="Retweets", ylab="Favorites")

dev.off()

dev.off()
```

To try and compare retweet and favorite distributions, I overlaid density plots of retweet and favorite data for the three tweets instead of overlaying scatterplots (would be too messy). You can kind of already get a sense of these conclusions from the scatterplots above but the density plots let you compare the three tweets a little easier than going back and forth between the above graphs.

The main takeaway here is that missing person and homicide retweet distributions are clustered closer to zero than the protest tweet distribution.

For favorites, DPD tweets about protests have a much wider range of distribution, and again, it looks like people really do not want to like tweets with information about homicides or missing people.

I think its pretty clear DPD tweet content is received by their followers and others in different ways depending on the content of the tweet. Protests are clearly more popular among the public, but I do think it is important for DPD to continue to tweet about serious crime - especially when they are able to identify suspects or "solve" the crime.
